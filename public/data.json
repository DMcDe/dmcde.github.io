            "description": ["The summer before my junior year, I worked as a Data Analyst Intern for Wilson Sporting Goods. My work centered around the Wilson Connected Football, a ball that collects statistics like exit velocity and spin rate every time it’s thrown. At the start of the internship, I was given data spanning almost a decade spread across hundreds of folders and tasked with centralizing it into a single database. I accomplished this task in under a week, and then used that database to explore numerous other questions of interest to drive growth both for the company and for the quarterbacks using the ball.", 
                            "Over the course of the internship, I spearheaded projects covering a wide range of fields. Highlights included creating a machine learning model that was able to categorize throws with 85% accuracy, creating predictive metrics to analyze likelihood of player success in key areas, developing novel data visualizations to increase customer interaction with the Wilson platform, and identifying areas for growth in market share and brand awareness.", 
                            "The work I completed had an immediate and significant impact at Wilson. I prototyped visuals that are now key pieces of the Wilson Connected web portal and developed methods for transforming statistics that are currently being used on the portal’s backend. In addition, trends that I identified and summarized were used in meetings with major clients as proof of our system’s success and validity.", 
                            "Working at Wilson also gave me valuable exposure to business analytics and operations management. From meeting one-on-one with mentors on the cutting edge of sales analytics learning about their efforts to modernize company procedures, attending lunch-and-learns with senior company leaders who shared their work and career paths, and collaborating with everyone from product line managers to software engineers, I gained a firm understanding of fundamental business concepts and the ways I could contribute to the success of the company.", 
                            "My projects gave me real-world experience using software development tools for data analysis including Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-Learn, Jupyter Notebooks, Matplotlib, and Plotly as well as software in the Microsoft suite, including Excel, Powerpoint, and Word. I was also introduced to agile development frameworks using tools like Jira and Confluence."],
